        <h2>About</h2><br>
        <p>The Bihu festival is being celebrated in Assam from the ancient times. Bihu festival occur according to the farming schedule. 
            Rongali or Bohag Bihu observed in April, Kongali or Kati Bihu observed in October, and Bhogali or Magh Bihu observed in January. The Rongali Bihu is the most important of the three, celebrating spring festival. The Bhogali Bihu or the Magh Bihu is a harvest festival, with community feasts. The Kongali Bihu or the Kati Bihu is the sombre, thrifty one reflecting a season of short supplies and is an animistic festival.</p><br>

            The word Bihu has been derived from the Deori (a Boro-Garo language) word Bisu which means "excessive joy". This older form of Bihu continue among the Chutias, Sonowal Kacharis, Thengal-Kacharis, Morans, and Deoris and Motoks. These groups were known as Sadiyal Kacharis were associated with the Kingdom of Sadiya. </p><br>
